This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in Swift: forgetting to include parameter labels when calling functions with named parameters.  While the compiler will often catch this, understanding how this can lead to unexpected behavior is crucial for writing robust Swift code.  The solution illustrates how to correctly use parameter labels.
